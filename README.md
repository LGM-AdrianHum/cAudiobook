cAudiobook
==========
Windows-based open source audiobook player for drm-free audiobooks. In its current status the app is useable but missing some features, see To-Do-list.

The program depends on two external assemblies:
* ![NAudio](NAudio "https://naudio.codeplex.com/")
* ![google-api-for-dotnet](google-api-for-dotnet "https://code.google.com/p/google-api-for-dotnet/")

To Do
-----
* Control to pause playback.
* Implement settings dialog (settings can currently be modified by editing a settings file).
* Sleep timer.
